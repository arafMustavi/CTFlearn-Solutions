Problem Name : Don't be salty 20

Problem Link : https://ctf.brixel.space/challenges#Don't%20be%20salty-25

Problem Description: Our l33t hackers hacked a bulletin board and gained access to the database. We need to find the admin password.

The user's database info is:

Username:admin

Passwordhash:2bafea54caf6f8d718be0f234793a9be

Salt:04532@#!!

We know from the source code that the salt is put AFTER the password, then hashed. We also know the user likes to use lowercase passwords of only 5 characters long.

The flag is the plaintext password.

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format


Solution Approach:


1) Generate All Possible 5 Length Strings [ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-combinations-of-given-length/]

2) Concate and Hash [ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sha-in-python/]

3) Compare with the Hashed Value which one matches
